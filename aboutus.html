            <p>A pet shop or pet store is a retail business which sells animals and pet care resources to the public. A variety of animal supplies and pet accessories are also sold in pet shops. The products sold include: food, treats, toys, collars, leashes, cat litter, cages and aquariums.<br>A good pet store should be neat and clean, well lit, and should have aisles wide enough to easily navigate. The cages of any animals should be clean and appropriately lit, and there should be evidence of cage cleaning. A good pet store will take measures to ensure the health of their animals.<br>Marketing your pet store is easy once you know the right tips and tricks. Create a referral program or loyalty program that rewards your brand advocates for sharing with their friends and consistently making more purchases. Post entertaining content in social media that pique the interest of potential customers.</p>
